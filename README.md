This project was written in 2015 when I was discovering what I could create with my skills. Today, with a more mature look, I can cite some necessary changes:
- store the password hash with a dynamic SALT
- adjust tabs and comments
- database indexing and triggers
- designers implementation
- etc


but I can say it was fun!
